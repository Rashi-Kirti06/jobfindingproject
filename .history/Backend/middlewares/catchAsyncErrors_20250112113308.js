/**
 * Explanation:
export const catchAsyncErrors:

This line declares a named export of a constant function called catchAsyncErrors.
This function can be imported and used in other files.
= (theFunction) => {:

This is an arrow function that takes one parameter named theFunction.
theFunction is expected to be another function (usually an asynchronous function) that you want to wrap for error handling.
return (req, res, next) => {:

The outer function catchAsyncErrors returns a new function.
The returned function takes three parameters: req, res, and next. These are typical parameters for middleware functions in Express.js.
req: The request object.
res: The response object.
next: A function that passes control to the next middleware in the stack.
Promise.resolve(theFunction(req, res, next)):

This line ensures that theFunction is treated as a Promise, even if it's not explicitly returning a Promise.
theFunction(req, res, next) is called with the req, res, and next arguments.
If theFunction is asynchronous (returns a Promise), Promise.resolve will handle its resolution.
.catch(error):

This line attaches a .catch handler to the Promise returned by Promise.resolve.
If theFunction throws an error (either synchronously or asynchronously), this .catch block will handle it.
error:

Here, error is a callback function or a handler where the caught error is passed.
However, there is a mistake here: error should be passed to next to follow Express.js error-handling conventions. This would allow the error to be passed to any error-handling middleware.
Corrected version:

javascript
Copy code
export const catchAsyncErrors = (theFunction) => {
    return (req, res, next) => {
        Promise.resolve(theFunction(req, res, next)).catch(next);
    }
}
Summary:
This code is a utility function designed to handle errors in asynchronous Express.js middleware or route handlers.
It wraps an asynchronous function (theFunction), ensures that any errors thrown are caught, and passed to the next function, allowing Express to handle them with its error-handling middleware.
Key Point: The main idea is to avoid the need for try-catch blocks in every async route handler or middleware and to centralize error handling.
